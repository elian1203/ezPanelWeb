## ezPanel

The open source Minecraft server panel.

### About

This is intended for those who want a simple Minecraft server panel, like Multicraft, with the open source benefits.

This is not intended to be a replacement for Multicraft, as I do not have the time to implement all of its features. I
will, however, accept pull requests to the project that provide new features or bug fixes.

#### Why?

I didn't feel like paying for Multicraft.

### Features

* Free!!
* Create as many servers as your machine can run!
* Start/Stop/Restart/Kill commands!
* Working console with command input!
* User system with advanced permissions!
* FTP access to your servers!
* Tasks to run certain command on a schedule!
* Edit server properties file through the panel!
* Update your server jar with the click of a button! (Only supporting Paper currently)
